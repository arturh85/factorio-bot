//!
//! The supervisor is a Lua script, so the thing that knows what a milestone is
//! lives on the Lua side. This is the surface it records through.
//!
//! Ticks are not passed in by the caller: a script has no way to know
//! `game.tick`, and a made-up tick would poison the one axis every other part
//! of this design indexes on. Each event is stamped with the tick from the most
//! recent reply the game sent us, which is as current as the last command
//! issued and honestly `null` before there has been one.
